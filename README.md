# Online store with its own custom CRM
Yeah.. I know the code here is a mess but this is my first big project and it is dear to me

## is implemented here:

• Authorization and registration system

• Adding/removing items to cart, calculating the sum of the total

• Search for items by price and attribute

• User profile with order history

• Admin panel with the ability to add / delete / edit items, also implemented the ability to change the status of the goods - sent, in processing, delivered, canceled, etc. 

• Storage of all data in the database

• Goods rendering using JSON
